# Phishing-Website-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This study delves into the application of machine learning algorithms for proactive detection of phishing websites based on URL data

Evaluated the performance of five well-regarded algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classification (corrected from Random Forest Regression), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Analysis employs a comprehensive dataset of 11,430 URLs meticulously curated with 87 informative features

These features encompass diverse aspects of a website, including its: URL structure and syntax: Length, presence of special characters, subdomains, etc.Web page content:Textual information, presence of specific keywords, HTML elements, etc

Logistic Regression(Accuracy score = 94.82%), Decision Tree (93.28%), Random Forest Classification(95.87%), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (94.15%), Naive Bayes(69.48%)
